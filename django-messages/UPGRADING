========================================
Upgrading django-messages 0.4.x to 0.5.x
========================================

To Upgrade from django-messages 0.4.x to django-messages 0.5.x the following
changes might be neccessary in your project.


Settings
--------

To avoid name clashes with the new django.contrib.messages app (new in Django 1.2)
the django-messages python module was renamed from ``messages`` to ``django_messages``.

This makes a change of the INSTALLED_APPS setting neccessary:

Old::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'messages',
        ...
    )
    
New::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'django_messages',
        ...
    )
    
If you are using the ``inbox`` context processor, the TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS
setting also needs to be changed:

Old::

    TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
        ...
        'messages.context_processors.inbox',
        ...
    )
    
New::

    TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
        ...
        'django_messages.context_processors.inbox',
        ...
    )
    

Templates
---------

To keep the convention that a reuseable app should keep its templates in a 
folder with the name of the app, all templates where moved from the folder
``messages`` to the folder ``django_messages``. That means if you provided
your own templates for django-messages, you should also move the directory from
``messages`` to ``django_messages``. Example::

    mv myproject/templates/messages myproject/templates/django_messages


Database
--------

Depending on the Database used this process may differ but you have to
rename the existing table ``messages_message`` to ``django_messages_message``.
